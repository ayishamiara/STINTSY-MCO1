    "## Features to be Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the 20 features in the dataset, the following features seem to be useful at first glance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`home_attacks`**\n",
    "2. **`away_attacks`**\n",
    "3. **`home_dangerous_attacks`**\n",
    "4. **`away_dangerous_attacks`**\n",
    "5. **`home_on_target`**\n",
    "6. **`away_on_target`**\n",
    "\n",
    "These features stand out as they can be used to identify a team's aggresiveness in trying to score for a goal. Attacks are used as a metric to show a certain team is going towards the goal, with dangerous attacks indicating they are in the danger zone, very near the goal. On target can also be used to show how a team's shots are accurate enough to be in the goal, needing the opposing goal keeper's intervetion to block it. While off target can be used to indicate that a ball was shot, it can be misleading as shooting the ball from very far out of bounds is also a tactic in football to delay the time for the opposing team. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compress these features, it is also possible to consolidate pairs into one feature:\n",
    "1. **`attacks_difference`** - The difference between the home **`home_attacks`** and the **`away_attacks`**.\n",
    "2. **`attacks_dangerouse_difference`** - The difference between the home **`home_dangerous_attacks`** and the **`away_dangerous_attacks`**\n",
    "3. **`on_target_difference`** - The difference between the home **`home_on_target`** and the **`away_on_target`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By consolidating these paired features, it can: reduce the dimensionality of your dataset. This is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of features, as it can simplify the model, improve output interpretability, and reduce computa. \n"

However, it is also worth noting that being the Home team has inherent advantages which may not be found in the data such as being more familiar with the playing environment, crowd support, and reduced travel-related fatigue. Therefore, the apparent class imbalance may be a reflection of these inherent advantages rather than a data-related issue.
